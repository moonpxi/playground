In <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_architecture" title="Ancient Egyptian architecture">Ancient Egyptian architecture</a> as early as 2600 BC the architect <a href="/wiki/Imhotep" title="Imhotep">Imhotep</a> made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds; in later Egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common.</p>
        <p>Some of the most elaborate columns in the ancient world were those of the <a href="/wiki/Persia" title="Persia" class="mw-redirect">Persians</a>, especially the massive stone columns erected in <a href="/wiki/Persepolis" title="Persepolis">Persepolis</a>. They included double-bull structures in their <a href="/wiki/Capital_(architecture)" title="Capital (architecture)">capitals</a>. <a href="/wiki/Apadana" title="Apadana">The Hall of Hundred Columns</a> at Persepolis, measuring 70&nbsp;× 70 metres, was built by the <a href="/wiki/Achaemenid" title="Achaemenid" class="mw-redirect">Achaemenid</a> king <a href="/wiki/Darius_the_Great_of_Persia" title="Darius the Great of Persia" class="mw-redirect">Darius I</a> (524–486 BC). Many of the ancient <a href="/wiki/Persian_column" title="Persian column">Persian columns</a> are standing, some being more than 30 metres tall.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

        <p>The Egyptians, Persians and other civilizations mostly used columns for the practical purpose of holding up the roof inside a building, preferring outside walls to be decorated with <a href="/wiki/Relief" title="Relief">reliefs</a> or painting, but the Ancient Greeks, followed by the Romans, loved to use them on the outside as well, and the extensive use of columns on the interior and exterior of buildings is one of the most characteristic features of classical architecture, in buildings like the <a href="/wiki/Parthenon" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. The Greeks developed the <a href="#Classical_orders">classical orders</a> of architecture, which are most easily distinguished by the form of the column and its various elements. Their <a href="/wiki/Doric_order" title="Doric order">Doric</a>, Ionic, and Corinthian orders were expanded by the Romans to include the Tuscan and Composite orders (see below).</p>
